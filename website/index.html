## Challenge

**Field Correspondent** is a collaboration of Simon O'Keefe and Herve Senot for the [Brisbane GIS Day 2014 Map App Hack](www.gisday.com.au/competitions/map-app-hack/), a nationwide open data competition. Our challenge is to...

> develop a great entrepreneurial and creative app that makes use of spatial technology and open data on a smartphone app platform.

In late October 2014, we brainstormed ideas about how we could use the concept of capturing photos from a phone (an exciting new feature in modern mobile browsers) and how it could relate to *open data*. **Field Correspondent** was born.

**Field Correspondent** enables you and the people you invite to capture photos and other information about places you care about - directly from a mobile device. No app installation required!

## A new generation information-gathering tool

Want to build a **photo library** of important historic sites in your area? Upload your location data and invite community members to capture the photos on their phones.

Want to promote a **winery tour** in your region? Upload your location data and send out a challenge for wine lovers to record each winery visit with a photo.

Want to keep a record of maintenance or inspections on your organisation's **assets, facilities or vegetation**. Upload your location data and invite your field workers to log their activities on their phone, including before and after photos.

Want to enable residents to notify you of **hazards, vandalism and littering** they discover directly from their phone. Embed the a Field Correpondent map in your website.
